                <div class="text-half">
                    <p>My name is Sam McNeil, and I am currently studying at NSCC Institute of Technology in the vibrant field of technology. I am in my first year of my coding journey, diving into the world of web development, particularly with HTML as a beginner.

                        While I'm still learning the ropes, I am incredibly passionate about technology and excited to grow my skills as I continue my studies. I find coding to be a fascinating challenge, and I enjoy problem-solving and building projects that help me improve my craft.
                        
                        Outside of coding, I have a wide range of hobbies that keep me entertained and inspired. I am an avid reader, always on the lookout for new books to dive into, whether it's fiction, non-fiction, or anything that sparks my curiosity. I also enjoy playing video games, whether it's exploring new virtual worlds or enjoying some friendly competition. Music is another important part of my life—whether it's listening to my favorite tracks or discovering new genres, music helps me relax and stay energized.
                        
                        I am proud to call Canada my home, where I get to enjoy the beautiful landscapes and the diverse culture. One of my favorite things about living here is the variety of food, but if I had to choose, my all-time favorite food would be burgers. There's nothing quite like a juicy burger, whether it's a classic or something more adventurous.
                        
                        As I continue my studies and grow in the world of coding, I look forward to learning more, building projects, and exploring new opportunities in the tech field.</p>

            <div class="mission-statement">
                <p>So I’m just starting out with coding and my mission is to learn as much as I can, get better at it and eventually make some cool stuff that could help people. I’m studying at NSCC Institute of Technology, working on HTML and web development right now. I still have a lot to learn but I’m super excited about it.
                    When I’m not coding I like to read, play video games and listen to music, those things help me chill and keep my mind creative. I want to keep getting better at coding and growing as a person, and maybe one day I can make something that actually makes a difference. For now I’m just gonna keep learning and doing my thing and see where it takes me.</p>

                <p>My journey at NSCC Institute of Technology has been a wild ride so far. When I first started, I had no idea what I was getting into, but I knew I wanted to learn about technology. I remember feeling a little overwhelmed at first, especially with HTML and coding. The first few weeks were tough, and I wasn’t sure if I could keep up. But over time, I started to get the hang of it. I realized that coding isn’t just about writing lines of text—it’s about solving problems and making ideas come to life on a screen. Every time I figured something out or finished a project, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment. Even when things didn’t go as planned, I learned that failure is just part of the process, and it’s okay to ask for help when you need it. The support from my teachers and classmates has been amazing. Everyone here is really encouraging, and we all try to help each other out. Outside of class, I’ve been experimenting with my own projects, making small websites, and just trying to put everything I’ve learned into practice. I also joined a few tech clubs at school, where I’ve met some really cool people who share the same interests. As I go through my first year, I’m starting to see how much there is to learn, and it’s exciting. There’s still a lot I don’t know, but every day I feel like I’m getting closer to where I want to be. I’m looking forward to exploring new technologies, building bigger projects, and someday being able to work on something that could really make a difference. Overall, NSCC has been an awesome place to start my tech journey, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.</p>
