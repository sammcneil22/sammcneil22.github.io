100 Word TXT final review
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the course of this semester I have learned quite alot about html and also css.
At the start I learned how to code basic things with html like headings and paragraphs. I
then proceeded to learn about links, images and other more advanced things i could do with
html. Then we got to CSS and learned to make things look pretty and how to make the layouts of our sites look
better. After that we just learned more stuff about CSS and HTML and how to turn our ideas into actual websites.
For this assignment I made my media query better and learned to change images which made my site alot better. We also learned how to host our site
on Github pages so anybody can see it. I got better at making the layout work and having things where I want them to be.
Overall I learned alot of great stuff in this course and my knowledge of html is alot better than it was
and I can turn my ideas into code much easier now.
